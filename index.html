                                <p>One of my favorite things to do in New York City is to visit Time's Square. It is located around 42nd Street and it really is where the heart of New York lives. Growing up i would always enjoy the bright vibrant colors that it had. As i grew older however i learned that it is a good place to visit not only to shop but to hang out with friends, adventure, and overall enjoy yourself. There are many places to find quality entertainment and there are some things you just won't find anywhere else in all of New York. If you're ever stopping by NYC I would advise checking out Time's Square before you go.</p>

                                <p>Governor's Island is a small Island that appears to no thave much. Although this is what it looks like, it actually is a vibrant piece of land that has beautiful fields and nice roads made for biking. The overall island isn't that large and most people are able to run around the island a few times. I personally find the secret garden of Hammocks to be fun since it is located in a nice quiet field that supplies sufficient shade to block out the fun and it is very good if you just want to relax and wind down. The island has a decent amount of places to get food and all it takes is a very to get to and from the Island. Weekends the ferry is free so you don't even have to worry about paying for it. If you enjoy nature, and want isolation from society than i would recommend visiting Governor's Island. </p>

                                <p>Anime Expo, or anime conventions in general are one of my favorite things to do in all of NYC. Conventions are a place where you can express your inner nerd/geek and interact with people who share similar interest with you. There are many conventions held throughout NYC aswell as throughout the world where you can just go to and find all sorts of fun and creative people. Most people decide to dress up or cosplay as one of their favorite characters from a show in order to get the feeling as though they were that character. This is done mostly at conventions due to the fact that the only real day we are allowed to dress up like that is Halloween. Some people may buy their cospalys while other people will find joy in making it themselves however, at the end of the day Conventions are just a place for you to express yourself and get to know people and make new connections. They also may have a supply of merchandise in which you can buy to add on to your collection. If you are in NYC or anywhere where there is a convention, i would definetly encourage you to try one out for yourself,\.</p>

                                <p>One Okay Rock is my favorite j-pop band. They have created some of my favorite songs and i just overall love their music. Everytime i listen to one of their new songs it gives me a reason to keep coming back for more. The song listed above is re:make and it is one of my favorite One Okay Rock songs.</p>

                                 <p>LISA is a name that stands for Love Is Same All and it was originally a japanese band. The lead singer Risa Oribe, became a stand alone singer that kept the name LISA for herself. She went on and did the opening from some of my favorite anime shows. The song above is called Crossing Fields and it is the opening to my favorite anime Sword Art Online.</p>

                                <p>Kagamine Len and Rin are my favorite Musicians on this list. This is due to the fact that they aresn't actual real people. They are actually a voice synthesize called vocaloids. Anyone has the ability to download the software and create their own music using the voices of these characters. Rin and Len's voices were made by the same person who uses two different pitches to make a seperate male and female voice. One the songs listed above is called Tokyo Teddy Bear using the voice of Rin Kagamine. </p>
